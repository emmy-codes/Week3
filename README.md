# Todo List App: JavaScript to TypeScript

## Contributors and their roles

- Faustina - Converting own component file/taking tickets as needed
- Gloria - Converting own component file/taking tickets as needed
- Emma - Converting own component file/taking tickets as needed, writing tickets, writing readme

## The purpose of this project

Our goal was to try and keep it simple to allow us to practice converting to TS whilst leaving time to do extra research and spend time fixing bugs/issues without stressing out about time constraints. We were in agreement that learning right now was more important than a big delivery or over-aiming and missing our goal.

The app itsself is a simple to-do list app which was created using React and Redux, taken from Gloria's repo.

## Challenges faced

The project itsself was fairly smooth - we met up went through the repo before agreeing upon it, deciding who would do what, our availabilities and such. We were juggling different schedules so we had an agile approach to time - any issues arose we would contact eachother on our group chat, and hop into a call at an agreed upon time later on. 

There were some challenges changing Redux as this was a new process but with some pair programming and Emma's TS expert fianc√© chipping in with some tips, we made it through!
